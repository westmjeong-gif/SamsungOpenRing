# SamsungOpenRing

> **This is an independent hobby project by a tinkerer who wanted more from his Galaxy Ring.** Samsung's double-pinch gesture is limited to two hardcoded actions (camera shutter and alarm dismiss). This project unlocks that gesture for whatever you want — open your parking gate, control your smart home, trigger automations, or anything else a webhook can reach. It is built for personal use and educational exploration of BLE protocols. Not affiliated with Samsung. No warranty. Use at your own risk.

Open-source SDK and companion app for the Samsung Galaxy Ring. Enables custom gesture-triggered actions without Samsung's official SDK.

## What it does

SamsungOpenRing connects to your Galaxy Ring over BLE as a second GATT client (alongside Samsung's official app) and lets you:

- **Detect double-pinch gestures** independently of Samsung's camera/alarm integration
- **Fire webhooks** on each gesture (control smart home, open gates, trigger automations)
- **Configure triggers** that automatically enable/disable gesture detection based on context

## How it works

The Samsung Galaxy Ring's BLE protocol was reverse-engineered from the companion app and live traffic captures. SamsungOpenRing sends the same `ENABLE_GESTURE` command that Samsung's camera app sends, allowing the ring to report pinch gestures directly to our app.

**No root required.** No modifications to Samsung's app. No ADB setup for basic functionality.

See [RFC-SGR-001](docs/RFC-SGR-001-Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-Protocol.md) for the full protocol specification.

## Features

### Core Library

```kotlin
// 3 lines to detect gestures
OpenRing.connect(context) { event ->
    Log.d("MyApp", "Pinch detected: ${event.gestureId}")
}
OpenRing.enableGestures { event ->
    // Handle gesture
}
```

### Companion App

- **Manual control** -- start/stop gesture monitoring with a button
- **Webhook integration** -- HTTP POST to any URL on each gesture
- **7 trigger types:**
  - Bluetooth device connection (e.g., car stereo)
  - Android Auto
  - WiFi network (by SSID)
  - Time schedule (start/end time + days of week)
  - Location geofence (lat/lng/radius)
  - Phone charging
  - App in foreground
- **Event log** with full BLE protocol trace, exportable for debugging
- **Auto-reconnect** with exponential backoff
- **Survives reboots** -- triggers re-arm automatically

## Installation

### From APK

1. Download the latest APK from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Install on your Samsung Galaxy phone (Android 12+)
3. Open the app, grant Bluetooth permission
4. Configure your webhook URL and triggers

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheVellichor/SamsungOpenRing.git
cd SamsungOpenRing
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Requires:
- Android SDK (compileSdk 34)
- JDK 17
- Galaxy Ring paired with your phone via Samsung's official app

## Requirements

- Samsung Galaxy phone with Android 12+ (API 31+)
- Samsung Galaxy Ring (SM-Q500/Q508/Q509) paired via Galaxy Wearable app
- Samsung's official Ring Manager app must remain installed (handles BLE bonding)

## Battery Impact

The ring's double-pinch detector keeps its motion sensor (IMU) in a high-power,
always-sampling mode. Samsung's own app only switches this on momentarily (camera
open, alarm ringing) precisely because leaving it on is the single biggest drain
on the ring — enough to cut a ~1-week battery down to ~1 day.

SamsungOpenRing therefore takes two precautions:

- **It does not fight Samsung's power management.** When Samsung's app duty-cycles
  gesture detection off, we respect that instead of immediately re-enabling it.
  (Older builds re-enabled on every external disable, which pinned the IMU on
  continuously — the classic "ring dies in a day" bug.)
- **Gestures stay on only for the genuine trigger window.** Detection is enabled
  when the first trigger activates and disabled when the last trigger deactivates
  (e.g. on for your drive while connected to the car, off when you disconnect).
- **An absolute safety cap bounds a stuck/forgotten window.** A hard ceiling
  (default 8 h, `DEFAULT_MAX_SESSION_MS` in `GestureService`) — measured from when
  gestures were first enabled and persisted so it survives reconnects and restarts
  — disables gestures and stops the service if a window never ends (a forgotten
  manual session, or a trigger that never fires its OFF edge). It is NOT reset by
  pinches or repeated trigger activations, so trigger churn can't extend it.
- **Lower-power BLE.** Our second connection requests
  `CONNECTION_PRIORITY_LOW_POWER` to relax the connection interval.

Net effect: the feature works across a normal window, while a stuck window can't
silently pin the ring's sensor for many hours. The second BLE connection itself is
cheap; it's the IMU, not the radio, that drains the ring.

> **Important:** per Samsung's own rating, gesture use is cheap, and the common
> "1-week → 1-day" Galaxy Ring drain is usually a hardware/firmware defect (a stuck
> sensor that Samsung replaces under warranty) or the ring being left out of its
> charging case — not this app. The debug build's **Claude Bridge** logs the ring's
> battery %/hour (`RING BATTERY` lines in the event log) so you can run a 24 h A/B
> (app armed vs fully stopped) and find out for sure.

## Architecture

```
SamsungOpenRing/
  core/     -- BLE connection, protocol, gesture detection (library)
  app/      -- Companion app with triggers, webhook, UI
```

### Core Library (`:core`)

- `OpenRing` -- public API entry point
- `RingConnection` -- BLE GATT client with auto-reconnect
- `RingProtocol` -- Samsung SAP message encoding/decoding
- `RingScanner` -- finds bonded Galaxy Ring from paired devices

### Companion App (`:app`)

- `GestureService` -- foreground service for persistent monitoring
- `WebhookSender` -- fires HTTP POST on gesture events
- `EventLog` -- persistent, rotatable event log
- `triggers/` -- pluggable trigger system

## Protocol

The Galaxy Ring uses a proprietary BLE protocol built on Samsung's Accessory Protocol (SAP). Key details:

- **GATT Data Service:** `00001b1b-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **Gesture Channel:** 22 (0x16)
- **Enable gestures:** Write `0x16 0x16 0x00` to TX characteristic
- **Disable gestures:** Write `0x16 0x16 0x01` to TX characteristic
- **Gesture event:** Notification `0x16 0x16 0x02 [counter] 0x00 0x00 0x00`
